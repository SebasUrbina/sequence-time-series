# Sequence Time Series - Deep Learning AI Course


This repo contains laboratories and homeworks from the course **[Sequences, Time Series and Prediction](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice)** from [deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai/)

## Week 1

### Lab 1: Introduction to Time Series Plots

> This notebook aims to show different terminologies and attributes of a time series by generating and plotting synthetic data. Trying out different prediction models on this kind of data is a good way to develop your intuition when you get hands-on with real-world data later in the course. Let's begin!

### Lab 2: Introduction to Time Series Plots

> In this lab, you will be doing some statistical forecasting so you can compare it with the machine learning models you will build later on.
